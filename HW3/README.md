In this Homework, I explored the Happiness dataset and performed similar exercises to the ones that was performed in class and previous assignment using the youtube data. I also worked on hypothesis testing specifically using the Kolmogorov-Smornoff test (KS-test). I was able to confirm whether the null hypothesis would either be accepted or rejected. This homework increased my knowledge on hypothesis and also tested my strength as to whether I understood previous concept done in class. I worked mainly by myself and sought explanations to unclear terms from my professor Dr. Bianco, and online resources.
