In this assignment, I was able to write captions for activities already completed by Prof. Bianco. I was able to work on work on the model: logistic regression aspect where i did activities such as initializing the model and fitting the model. I concluded the assignment by performing the required excercises for the model evaluation. I learned and gained more understanding of the confusion matrix. I worked independently on this homework.
